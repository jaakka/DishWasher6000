# DishWasher6000

This is the third version of my Arduino-based dishwasher control project. The focus is on implementing core functionality and safety features before adding animations or extra features.

## Features

- Relay control for dishwasher components
- Safety logic to prevent dangerous operations in fault situations
- Sensor reading for door, flood, overheat, water quality, and water level

## Structure

- `src/` – Source code files
- `include/` – Header files
- `pins.h` – Pin definitions
